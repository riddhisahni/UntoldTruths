            <h1>Dolores Huerta</h1>

            <p1>  “Every moment is an organizing opportunity, every person a potential activist, every minute a chance to change the world.”

                <br><br><p2>Dolores Huerta was born in Dawson, New Mexico (a “small mining town in the mountains of Northern New Mexico) and lived in Stockton, California. Her career in organization and activism began with the “Stockton Community Service Organization (CSO). During this time she founded the Agricultural Workers Association, set up voter registration drives and pressed local governments for barrio improvements.” At the CSO, she met César E. Chávez. In 1962, the two created the National Farm Workers Association, where “her lobbying and negotiating talents were demonstrated in securing Aid For Dependent Families (“AFDC”) and disability insurance for farm workers in the State of California in 1963, an unparalleled feat of the times. She also influenced the Agricultural Labor Relations Act of 1975. Huerta’s methods included grassroots organization, boycotts and non-violence. 
                </p2>
                <br><br><p3>During Huerta’s time as an activist and organizer, Huerta encountered Gloria Steinem, and “consciously began to challenge gender discrimination within the farm workers’ movement.” She also created the Dolores Huerta Foundation to protect Civil RIghts and equality related legislation. She spends her time speaking to immigrants in the “San Joaquin Valley of California” to teach them about their rights and benefits.</p3>
