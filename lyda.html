            <p1> “I builded the hut close to the grave of my mother and I felt secure every moment of my stay in the grounds that may appear to you, gloomy, but sacred to me for their memories.”

                <p>“In 1869, Eliza “Lyda” Conley was born to Eliza Conley of the Wyandot and Andrew Conley of England.” She went on to attend the Kansas City School of Law, becoming the first woman of the Kansas bar in 1902. As a member of the Wyandot tribe, Conley protected the Huron Indian Cemetery from being sold as Kansas City rapidly developed. Conley was among the leaders of this effort; they created “Fort Conley” to physically protect the cemetery. Legally, Conely faced many obstacles in her efforts to file a petition to protect the cemetery, in part due to the question of her U.S. or tribal citizenship. Her and her sisters even faced the threat of military opposition, though troops never came. “On January 14, 1910, Lyda finally ‘stood before the United States Supreme Court to appeal the dismissal of the suit that she had filed against Secretary of the Interior James Garfield in 1907.’ She was the first Native American woman, and the third woman, to argue a case before the U.S. Supreme Court.” In 1946, Conley passed away, and she was buried in the cemetery. Her sisters were buried there as well. Their efforts, however, did not go in vain; “1971, the cemetery was placed on the National Register of Historic Sites.”
