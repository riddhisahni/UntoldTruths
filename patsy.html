            <p1> “It is easy enough to vote right and be consistently with the majority. But it is more often more important to be ahead of the majority, and this means being willing to cut the first furrow in the ground and stand alone for a while if necessary.”</p1>

                <br><br><p2>Patsy Mink is the first Japanese-American Congresswoman from Hawaii. She was “born in Paia, Hawaii Territory, on December 6, 1927.” Mink pursued a “BA in zoology and chemistry from the University of Hawaii in 1948,” but she ended up attending the University of Chicago Law School. At the University of Chicago, she met John Francis Mink, whom she later married. As a result of her interracial marriage, Mink faced “discrimination from bigger firms… [so she] went into private law practice and lectured on business law at the University of Hawaii.” Her political career began In the 1950s, when she served in Hawaii’s Territorial Senate, where she “frequently broke with party leadership.” Then, in 1959, Hawaii became a state with one representative in the House, so Mink engaged in a congressional race where she faced challenges from her own party (from John Burns, Hawaii’s delegate and a political leader of the state’s Democratic Party). While she lost this race, it did not stop her. In 1962, Mink served on the Hawaii state senate, and in 1962, Hawaii gained a second seat in the House-- a seat that she won through grassroots support (and little to no party support). She continuously ran for re-election throughout the 1960s, until she “ran unopposed in 1970 and won 53 percent of the vote in 1972 and 63 percent in 1974.” Mink resumed a role in Congress in the 90s.</p2>
                <br><br><p3>Mink’s accomplishments in Congress included various education and health care reform policies. She spent her time on the Committee on Education And Labor fighting for the “first childcare bill and legislation establishing bilingual education, student loans, special education, professional sabbaticals for teachers, and Head Start.” She also attempted to get The Comprehensive Child Development Act passed to “institute a national daycare system.” Mink was also an advocate for Asian Pacific American national issues, supported President Lyndon B. Johnson’s Great Society legislation, spoke against the Vietnam War, and worked on women’s rights legislation such as the 1974 Women’s Educational Equity Act and Title IX. After her death in September of 2002, Mink’s name remained on the ballot and she was re-elected.</p3>
