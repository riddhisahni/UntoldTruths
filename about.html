        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>As three young women of color living and studying in the United States, we often open our history textbooks to see the accomplishments of straight white men. It is rare for us to see ourselves - our races, cultures, gender, and sexual orientations - reflected in the material that American society casts as valuable to our education. That is why we created this app, Untold Truths. In a world where media is at our fingertips, we want to use technology to empower girls and women of color in the United States by showing them the formidable accomplishments of women with whom they can identify. <br><br>

            Untold Truths is more than an app; it is a phenomenon to showcase women of color in history and in the modern day. It is a collective effort to write these women back into the narrative of American history. It is a platform for activism, empowerment, inspiration, and most importantly, education. <br><br>
            
            We are passionate about this project. If this app were to enter the market, we would envision it to be a non-profit educational platform. The information we include would all be properly cited, and the entries of Untold Truths users would be checked for factual accuracy.<br><br>
