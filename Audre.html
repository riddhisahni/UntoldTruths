            <h1>Audre Lorde</h1>

            <p1>“My sexuality is part and parcel of who I am, and my poetry comes from the intersection of me and my worlds… Jesse Helms’s objection to my work is not about obscenity … or even about sex. It is about revolution and change.”</p1>

                <br><br><p2>Born in New York City in 1934 “to West Indian immigrant parents,” Audre Lorde began publishing poetry as a high school student. After attending Hunter College and graduating with a Masters in Library Studies from Columbia University, Lorde worked as a librarian throughout the 1960s. “In 1972, Lorde met her long-time partner, Frances Clayton. She also began teaching as poet-in-residence at Tougaloo College. Her experiences with teaching and pedagogy—as well as her place as a Black, queer woman in white academia—went on to inform her life and work.” Lorde “was central to many liberation movements and activist circles, including second-wave feminism, civil rights and Black cultural movements, and struggles for GLBQT equality.”
                </p2>
                <br><br><p3>Lorde published a variety of poetry and prose, including The Cancer Journals, a work about her inner thoughts on death, prosthesis, and other hardships she faced as a breast cancer patient, and Zami: A New Spelling of My Name. “In 1981 Lorde and fellow writer Barbara Smith founded Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press, which was dedicated to furthering the writings of black feminists.” Lorde has received a variety of honors and awards for her work, activism, and accomplishments.
